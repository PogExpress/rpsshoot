5/12/24 - I've been on this project for like 2 weeks and I've gotten to nowhere,
none of my Rock Paper Scissors buttons are working and only the test button is working. Maybe it has something to do we scope or is there like a little error in it, I just really want this to work without relying on others because I am independent... also because all the tutorials that I look up on this don't even discuss the project or show the actual programming.
